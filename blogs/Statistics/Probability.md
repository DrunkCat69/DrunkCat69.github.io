# A/B Testing

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is A/B Testing?

A general methodology used online when you wanna test out a new product or a feature. Use two sets of users: control set (existing product) and experiment set (new version) by obsevering how these users respond differently to determine which version of feature/product is better.

### 1.2 Pros & Cons

- **useful:** 1) help you climb to the peak of your current mountain

- **not useful:** 1) test new experiences; old users may resist against the new version (change aversion), or old users may all go for the new experience, then test everything (novelty effect). Two issues to consider when it comes to a new experience: (1) what is your baseline of comparison? (2) how much time do you need in order for your users to adapt to the new experience, so that you can actually say what is the plateaued experience and make a robust decision? 

  2) long term effect is hard to test too, such as a website that recommends apartment rentals; note update brand or logo can't use ab testing, it's surprisingly emotional and users need some time to get used to new logo 

  3) can't really tell you if you're missing something
